## About Drawsultation

Drawsultation is a simple web app that allows a single user to freestyle draw and then save that drawing as a PNG, JPEG, or SVG. The app intentionally has a limited color pallette of only eight colors for simplicity and creative constraint.

Drawsultation was created in a week for the Fall 2021 Hiring Hackathon hosted by [Mintbean](https://www.mintbean.io/).
